/**
 * Decorator which can be applied to subclasses of a BitstreamElement class which marks the subclass 
 * as an option for "upgrading" an element being read. In order for the subclass to be considered, the 
 * given discriminant function must be true when called passing the instance of the superclass which is 
 * currently being read. The process of determining which variant subclass should be used is called "variation".
 * By default variation occurs once all fields of the superclass have been read unless the superclass has a
 * `@VariantMarker` decorator, in which case it is performed at the point in the structure where the variant 
 * marker is placed.
 * 
 * Note that the default type assigned to the "element" parameter of the passed variant discriminant is 
 * actually the type that the decorator is placed on, but that's technically not correct, since the passed 
 * value is an instance of the parent class. Right now Typescript doesn't have a way to type this, and we
 * figured it was better to be brief and almost correct than the alternative.
 * 
 * If you want to ensure the type of the element pasesd to the discriminator is exactly correct, specify the 
 * type parameter (ie `@Variant<ParentClass>(i => i.parentProperty)`) 
 * 
 * @param discriminant A function which determines whether the Variant is valid for a given object being read
 * @param options A set of options that modify the applicability of the variant. @see VariantOptions
